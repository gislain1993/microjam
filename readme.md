## What is it ?

Greek letter `'Î¼'` is pronounced `'my'` as in `micro`, `'mu'` as in `'music'` or `'mee'` according to [modern Greek](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-greek-alphabet-1705558). In that context here it simply means *tiny* or  *minimalistic*.

That `'Jam'` in &mu;Jam comes from `Jamstack` and means the collection of the three attributes
* **J** avaScript
* **A** PI
* **M** arkup

It is mostly about the creation of static web pages or *serverless* websites and you might want to [read more](https://jamstack.org/) about that modern way to build lightweight web pages [here](https://jamstack.wtf/) and [there](https://jamstack.email/).

## What can I do with it ?

If you want to 
* create a small to medium website
* write down the contents of your web pages in that easy to learn and use [Markdown language](https://commonmark.org/help/)
* publish your web-pages to your GitHub repository and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* do that all from inside free [*Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (`vscode`) editor

then the minimalistic and powerful approach of &mu;Jam might convice you.
