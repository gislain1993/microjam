#  Introduction

## What is it ?

Greek letter `'Î¼'` is pronounced `'my'` as in `micro`, `'mu'` as in `'music'` or `'mee'` according to [modern Greek](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-greek-alphabet-1705558). In that context here it simply means *tiny* or  *minimalistic*.

That `'Jam'` in &mu;Jam comes from `Jamstack` and means the collection of the three attributes
* **J** avaScript
* **A** PI
* **M** arkup

It is mostly about the creation of static web pages or *serverless* websites and you might want to [read more](https://jamstack.org/) about that modern way to build lightweight web pages [here](https://jamstack.wtf/) and [there](https://jamstack.email/).

## What can I do with it ?

If you want to 
* create a small to medium website
* write down the contents of your web pages in that easy to learn and use [Markdown language](https://commonmark.org/help/)
* publish your web-pages to your GitHub repository and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* do that all from inside free [*Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (`vscode`) editor

then the minimalistic and powerful approach of &mu;Jam might convice you.

## I am not a programmer !

You don't need to be one ... promised.

At first you need to install the free and open source [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) editor. Chances are you already have it. But you can also do that later.

## Yet another Jamstack Approach ?

Hmm ... there are in fact a [lot static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) available and here are [some ways](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) to find your [best Jamstack approach](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/choosing-your-ssg/).

Many of them

* are highly configurable.
* depend on a certain programming language.
* have fine grained control via command line usage.

So if this is exactly what you want, go on ... I recommend to have a closer look at [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev).

> With &mu;Jam I want to offer my mechanical engineering students and a certain number of interested colleagues a tool, which
> *  allows to create small to medium project specific websites.
> *  is easy to learn and use.
> *  does not require programming skills.
> *  can handle LaTeX math expressions natively,
> *  integrates static or dynamic vector graphics
> *  offers comfortable Html previewing
> *  supports high quality research paper `pdf`-format output.
> 
> As a result &mu;Jam is considered a [low code publishing tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-code_development_platform) for scientists, engineers and students.

In this sense &mu;Jam is minimalistic, as it does quite well, what it is intended to do, but not more. And as you can easily leave that *math*, *vector graphics* and *research paper* stuff out, it may serve your publishing wishes well.
In this possible case you are invited to read on.

This is my second relevant VSCode extension. My other one is [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath).
If you want to know a bit more about myself, you might get a compact overview on my [research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stefan_Goessner) profile.
