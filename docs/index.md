# Triangle Inequality

In Euclidean geometry, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two side vectors $\bold a$ and $\bold b$ must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side vector $\bold c$.

hello hghghg

$$c \le a + b$$ (1)

<g-2 id='g' width="601" height="401" cartesian x0="200" y0="100"></g-2>


For proofing this, we substitute $\bold c = \bold a + \bold b$ in (1) while squaring both sides

$$(\bold a + \bold b)^2 \le (a + b)^2$$

and resolving to

$$a^2 + 2\bold a\bold b + b^2 \le a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$

yields the vectorial form in $\mathbb R^2$ of the triangle inequality.
